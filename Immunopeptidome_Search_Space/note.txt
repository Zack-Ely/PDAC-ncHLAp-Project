The scripts here represent various major pieces of the immunopeptidome
search space creation process described in our manuscript.


We have omitted scripts related to somatic mutation protein searches
in nuORF regions, since we did not ultimately find these in our
immunopeptidome searches. Please feel free to reach out to us
if you would like these scripts for your own purposes.
